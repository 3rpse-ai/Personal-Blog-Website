        <p>Have you ever noticed this strange feeling? You start you car and something just doesnt feel right? In
          addition to this everslight smell of burnt oil suddenly you hear your pistons play the triangle on your
          cylinders. And then - no one could have guessed - you suddenly stop in the end of nowhere. A true nightmare!
        </p>
        <p>Your pistons got stuck. They are basically one with the cylinders now. An unseparable, highly affectionate
          duo. Romantic.</p>
        <p>Scientists have now found the ultimate cause for that. After investigating 1000 peoples' stranded cars it was
          obvious. 990 cars out of the 1000 (so 99%! - shocker) saw a blinking oil lamp before breaking down. Mr.
          Pisston - a leading scientist, well-known for his peer-ignored research on astrology, confirmed that by that
          it is proven.</p>
        <blockquote>
          "How could the manufacturers be so bold? How can you actually put something bound to fail a car right on a
          large production"
        </blockquote>
        <p>he shouts as he furiously stabs his car's dashboard panel with an already slightly bent screwdriver. Now I
          will never break down when running from reality ever again!</p>
        <p>We wish Mr Pisston best of luck in his future endeavors and are looking forward to his upcoming scientific
          insights.</p>
